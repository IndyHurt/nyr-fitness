Add that one first.  Do you pass by a fitness center that you are curious about on your way home from work every day?  Don’t be shy.  Stop in and ask for information.  Save those details in OpenStreetMap for future retrieval.  Maybe you just need a fitness gadget or some new fitness apparel to kick your fitness resolution into overdrive!  What is your go-to sporting goods store?  Add it to OpenStreetMap.  \r\n\r\n####Interactive Map\r\nWould it be helpful to see where the current fitness related POIs are in OpenStreetMap?  There's a map for that!  Hover over any of the bright blue highlighted fitness points of interest to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add additional tags.\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" frameBorder=0 style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://indyhurt.github.io/nyr-fitness/map_fitness/embed.html?fitness\"></iframe><p class='caption'>(This map is interactive! <a style=\"font-weight:normal\" href=\"http://indyhurt.github.io/nyr-fitness/map_fitness/?fitness\">Open full screen ➹</a> )</p>  \r\n\r\nIs your go-to fitness place missing all together?  Shift-click anywhere on the map to open iD or open your favorite OpenStreetMap editor to start mapping!\r\n\r\n####Getting Started with OpenStreetMap\r\nNeed instructions on how to edit with iD? Here are some links to outstanding tutorials from LearnOSM, the OpenStreetMap wiki, and the United States Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit:\r\n\r\n\r\n* [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/)\r\n* [OSM Beginners' Guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners'_guide)\r\n* [MapGive Learn to Map](http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/)\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you a mapping wiz and interested in a more advanced editor? Try out [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) with [excellent documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/osm-mapping-guide/) from Mapbox.\r\n\r\n####Editing with a Mobile Device\r\nWith points of interest, I bet you are interested in a mobile app to edit OpenStreetMap while you are on the go.  iOS users can check out [Go Map!!](https://appsto.re/us/dafwJ.i) by Bryce Cogswell.  This free editor allows you to add features and edit existing features.  Check out the [Go Map!!](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Go_Map!!) wiki page for more details.\r\n\r\nLooking for an Android equivalent?  [Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android) by Marcus Wolschon is a great option.  Check out the [Vespucci](http://vespucci.io) home page for documentation and tutorials.\r\n\r\n* Careful, now.  Adding and enhancing features in OpenStreetMap is fun, but to burn lots of calories editing, you'll need a treadmill desk.  Get outside, increase your local knowledge, and when you return, OpenStreetMap will be ready for your edits!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
